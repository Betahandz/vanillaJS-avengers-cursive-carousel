## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use the clip-path CSS property to or cut the view of objects to what is required.

### Continued development

Firstly I would also love to create this using react, also will love to create complex shapes with css properties.

### Useful resources

- [Clip Path Generator](https://www.cssportal.com/css-clip-path-generator) - This helped me to get a generated clip path,
and helped me to understand the axis of creating on. Well we only need to understand the basic concept.
